Pycaret Overview
- Low-code machine learning library that automates machine learning
- Can replace hundreds of lines of code with only a few words
- Python wrapper around several machine learning libraries, like scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, and more

Why Use It?
- Allows a less experienced coder to become a “citizen data scientist” – a less experienced coder who is now able to perform sophisticated techniques that would have previously required much more expertise
- Experienced data scientists can be expensive and difficult to find, so the emergence of citizen data scientists can be helpful for businesses

Machine Learning Modules Available
- Classification
- Regression
- Time Series
- Clustering 
- Anomaly Detection
- Datasets

Installation
```
pip install pycaret
```
